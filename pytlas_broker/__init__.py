"""The pytlas_broker module exposes everything you need to use the pytlas library
across a wide range of channels such as MQTT or a GSM module mounted on a Pi.

Basically, you will open multiple Channels, instantiate a Server and attach it to
all channels. Then, use a Client to connect to the Server for a particular Channel.
